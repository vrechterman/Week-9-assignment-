    Design Memo
    For this assignment we were working with hash tables for a small contact management system, 
    with this program it will be able to store the contacts, as well as adding, updating, and 
    searching them in the smoothest way possible. For this assignment using a hash table is the 
    best way going about it because it will allow faster look ups, updates, and it will convert 
    each of the contacts names into a numeric index so that it cam be found and stores immediately 
    and directly. There are many different methods used, such as hash_function(key), insert(key,value), 
    search(key), and print_table(). Now in the hash table there are collisions and these are handled 
    through separate chaining. With this each of the indexâ€™s in the table hold the head of the 
    linked lists, and if there are many in the same index then it will be stored in that list. 
    This is so that there is no data lost. A lot of people actually choose hash tables over a 
    list or even a tree when the goal is quick access by key. So with this assignment I was able to 
    learn more about how hashing works, and learn how collision handling works while using separate chaining.
